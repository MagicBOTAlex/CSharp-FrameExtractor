# CSharp-FrameExtractor

This project is mostly made for me, so i can extract the frames from a video using 100% of my CPU
I code for fun but im still a beginner.

Please tell me all the problems with my code. I'm still trying to improve myself.

I will be using this software for photogrammetry and such. You could maybe use this for neural networks or something. i dont know.
