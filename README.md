# CSharp-FrameExtractor

**How to use:**

2. Select your video

You can optionally choose more processes to use. Sometimes it's faster and sometimes it's slower.


This project is mostly made for me, so i can extract the frames from a video using 100% of my CPU.
I code for fun but im still a beginner.

Please tell me all the problems with my code. I'm still trying to improve myself. And also tell me if i'm using Github wrong.

I will be using this software for photogrammetry and such. You could maybe use this for neural networks or something. i dont know.
